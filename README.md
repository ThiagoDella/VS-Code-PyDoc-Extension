# PyDoc README

This VSCode extension helps in adding Docstrings to your python code. Currently docstrings for `Functions` and `Classes` are supported.

## Features

Describe specific features of your extension including screenshots of your extension in action. Image paths are relative to this README file.

For example if there is an image subfolder under your extension project workspace:

\!\[feature X\]\(images/feature-x.png\)

> Tip: Many popular extensions utilize animations. This is an excellent way to show off your extension! We recommend short, focused animations that are easy to follow.

## Requirements

If you have any requirements or dependencies, add a section describing those and how to install and configure them.

## Extension Settings

After you have installed the extension:

* Select the function/class that you want to write the docstring for
* Hit `Ctrl+Shift+P` which brings up the command palette
* Select `Docstring` and hit `Enter`
